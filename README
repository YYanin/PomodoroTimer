Description:
        A terminal based pomodoro timer/ interval timer



Input:

Time in min for both the work time and rest time. Also takes in the number of work sessions you want to do. The input has to be a positive integer. If you put anything else, the timer will not accept it and will recursevly ask you for a valid input.

I'm not adding hours at the moment as usually people prefer time intervals of less than an hour

After the timer runs out, the code makes a beeping noise on all platforms via a a bell character. 

When all work sets are complete, the timer beeps 3 times




***NOTE
Some terminals have an option to ingnore said bell characters. Make sure the setting is enabled

command to execure the script:

python3 timer.py
